ThrongBot is an application to run and manage multiple instances of 
the Abot Web Crawler (https://code.google.com/p/abot/).  The instances of 
Abot spawned in this application have been customized to use a shared datasource.

ThrongBot also uses many other awesome open source software:  Log4Net, NInject, NUnit, and Moq.

More to come.

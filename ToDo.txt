Add restart ability:  If a crawler is stopped or errors out, the crawl definition in the repository 
should still be flagged as "InProgress".  Additionally, you should be able to call the "next link to crawl"
for the specified sessionId and base domain and restart the crawl.

Add deployment configuration checker, a quick app to check deployment configs like database connectivity, webb service connectivity, etc.
